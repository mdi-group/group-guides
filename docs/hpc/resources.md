# Resources

A list of various HPC resoruces and how to access them

## MCC

The Materials Chemistry Consortium gives us access to a number of resources including ARCHER2 and Young. Below is a guide on how to sign up to the MCC. We then apply for resource twice yearly. Please also look at different systems pages for detailed information on using them.

### Sign up 
* Sign up for an account on SAFE: https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk/
  - After signing up go to 'Login accounts' > 'Request login' > Project e05
* Make sure Keith emails Scott (scott.woodley@ucl.ac.uk; klmc.mcc@ucl.ac.uk) to tell him the name and nationality of the applicant

* MCC announcments: [http://www.ucl.ac.uk/klmc/mcc](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/klmc/mcc)

* Applications - One group summary form (in `ktb-projects-notes/Admin/hpc/mcc`)

### Acknowledgements 

When publishing work that benefited from resources allocated by the MCC: please include the following acknowledgment 
```
Via our membership of the UK's HEC Materials Chemistry Consortium,
which is funded by EPSRC (EP/R029431), this work used the
```
 followed by the appropriate acknowledgement for ARCHER2, THOMAS,
 or YOUNG. For example, 
```
ARCHER2 UK National Supercomputing Service (http://www.archer2.ac.uk).
```
for ARCHER2, 
```
the UK Materials and Molecular Modelling Hub for computational 
resources, MMM Hub, which is partially funded by EPSRC (EP/P020194) 
```
for THOMAS, and 
```the UK Materials and Molecular Modelling Hub for computational resources, MMM Hub, which is partially funded by EPSRC (EP/T022213)
```
for YOUNG.

If space is limited, please ensure the name of the HEC platform, the phrase "Materials Chemistry Consortium" and *most importantly* any relevant EPSRC grant numbers (e.g. EP/R029431) is acknowledged.

## UCL HPC 

UCL also has local HPC, eg Myriad and Kathleen. To learn more and to sign up for these please go to the UCL HPC pages [https://signup.rc.ucl.ac.uk/computing/requests/new](https://signup.rc.ucl.ac.uk/computing/requests/new)
